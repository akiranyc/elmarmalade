    <i>2014-08-26</i> - lots of marmalade updates including new terms and docs pages and a couple of bug fixes.
</p>

<p>
    <i>2014-08-24</i> - marmalade-repo is now hosted on <a href="http://docker.io">docker</a><br></br>
    Docker makes the whole thing easier to deploy. So it should be easier to keep up to date.

<p>
    <i>2014 06 15</i> - Marmalade uploads are live<br></br>
    You can now upload more safely. The API is somewhat fixed though we
    still seem to have some bugs. I've been working hard on the blue-green
    aspect of marmalade configuration which will allow me to roll releases
    with no downtime. I'm going to have to docker-ize Emacs to do that I
    think.

<p>
    <i>2014 06 08</i> - marmalade is missing some packages<br></br>

    Reference this it seems that the mongo conversion missed some
    stuff. So I'll have to go and work on that to see if I can dredge
    it up.
