        <i>2014-10-23</i> - marmalade-repo is now on HTTPS.
        <div>
            The marmalade-client has been updated too and we're
            redirecting all HTTP to HTTPS. So if you have a client
            problem it's probably that. Please just upgrade the
            <a href="/packages/marmalace-client">marmalade client.</a>

        <i>2014-10-17</i> - user creation and package removal features are added;
        <div>
            We're nearing having a usable service now. To create an
            account you still need to make a ticket and for Nic to
            send you an email... but at least all that is automated
            now. It's only a relatively small step to add a
            registration front end to the existing API calls.

        <i>2014-09-27</i> - docker deployment is now watching marmalade for failures and auto restarting.
        <div>
            Marmalade has been down a lot, clearly there is an elnode
            problem somewhere. Restarting is a great way to deal with the
            problem though. I may even more aggressively restart it and
            call it a chaos strategy.

    <li>
        <i>2014-08-26</i> - lots of marmalade updates including new terms and docs pages
        <div>
            A couple of bug fixes too.
        </div>

    <li>
        <i>2014-08-24</i> - marmalade-repo is now hosted on <a href="http://docker.io">docker</a>
        <div>
            Docker makes the whole thing easier to deploy. So it
            should be easier to keep up to date.

        <i>2014 06 15</i> - Marmalade uploads are live
        <div>
            You can now upload more safely. The API is somewhat fixed though we
            still seem to have some bugs. I've been working hard on the blue-green
            aspect of marmalade configuration which will allow me to roll releases
            with no downtime. I'm going to have to docker-ize Emacs to do that I
            think.

    <li>
        <i>2014 06 08</i> - marmalade is missing some packages
        <div>
            Reference <a
            href="https://github.com/nicferrier/elmarmalade/issues/27">this</a>
            it seems that the mongo conversion missed some stuff. So I'll
            have to go and work on that to see if I can dredge it up.
