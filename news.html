<ul>
<li>
    <i>2014-08-26</i> - lots of marmalade updates including new terms and docs pages and a couple of bug fixes.

<li>
    <i>2014-08-24</i> - marmalade-repo is now hosted on <a href="http://docker.io">docker</a>
    <div>Docker makes the whole thing easier to deploy. So it should be easier to keep up to date.</div>

<li>
    <i>2014 06 15</i> - Marmalade uploads are live
    <div>
        You can now upload more safely. The API is somewhat fixed though we
        still seem to have some bugs. I've been working hard on the blue-green
        aspect of marmalade configuration which will allow me to roll releases
        with no downtime. I'm going to have to docker-ize Emacs to do that I
        think.

<li>
    <i>2014 06 08</i> - marmalade is missing some packages
    <div>
        Reference <a
        href="https://github.com/nicferrier/elmarmalade/issues/27">this</a>
        it seems that the mongo conversion missed some stuff. So I'll
        have to go and work on that to see if I can dredge it up.
