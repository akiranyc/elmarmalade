* elmarmalade-package-archives
** needs an ALL query
*** needs to be everything
** needs rendering to what archive-contents looks like
** what's the correct mime type to send
*** ngrep a transaction

* elmarmalade--package-list
** could write a test to construct the list and start a real emacs using it
*** emacs can have a package-archive which is local
*** it needs the archive file still
*** so
**** make the archive content
**** save it to a file
**** start an emacs with the package-archives pointing at it
**** do something to assert it's correct

* elmarmalade-package
** abstract elnode-docroot-for over elnode db?
** what does the package download look like?

* elmarmalade-handler
** add the user facing front end stuff
*** login
*** register
*** upload
**** this should be particularly simple
**** is there a standard for this in package-x or something?


* authentication
** we have basic auth
** we need permission upload
*** we need to know which packages have which owners
*** package db needs to be updated
*** this is what marmalade!authorize-check is
